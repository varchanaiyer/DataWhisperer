    The process of preprocessing any dataset is as follows:
    - **Handle Missing Values:** Missing values are handled using KNN Imputation
    for numerical, and most_frequent imputation for categories.
    - **Handle Exact Duplicates:** Exact duplicates, are simply handled
    by removal.
    - **Removing Outliers:** Outliers from the dataset, are handled by removal.
    - **Feature Category Encoding:** Features which are categories are encoded
    using the OneHotEncoder.
    - **Target Encoding:** Targets are encoded using a LabelEncoder
    - **Data Splitting:** Data is split into training, test and validation splits,
    60% training, 20% for validation and testing.
    - **Scaling Numerical Features:** All numerical features are scaled separately
    for training, testing and validation.
